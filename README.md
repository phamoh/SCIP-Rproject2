# SCIP-Rproject2

This repository contains the files of a project I created for beginners in R in the Science Coding Immersion Program (SCIP). 

This project was inspired by an [LA Times online article][ref1] about tracking coronavirus vaccinations in California. Participants in the SCIP program were to recreate two graphics found in the article based on data downloaded on May 10, 2021. The data downloaded was from [California Open Data][ref2].
- Graphic 1: Percentage of Californians who are partially or fully vaccinated

- Graphic 2: Vaccine doses administered by day
