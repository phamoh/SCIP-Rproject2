# SCIP-Rproject2

This repository contains the files of a project I created for beginners in R in the Science Coding Immersion Program (SCIP). 

This project was inspired by an [LA Times online article][ref1] about tracking coronavirus vaccinations in California. Participants in the SCIP program were to recreate two graphics found in the article.
- Graphic 1: Percentage of Californians who are partially or fully vaccinated
- Graphic 2: Vaccine doses administered by day
